This is a simple WebGL Widget based on some freelance work that failed to materialise, so here it is as a portfolio piece.
It should be easy to add to any page, just include 
  &lt;script id="m3s-wgl-widget" src="m3s-widget-setup.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
and
  &lt;div id="LogoGenerator"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
where you want the widget to appear

I've implemented the widget in Three.js, Babylon.js and PlayCanvas engine. The widget defaults to Three.js bu a different engine can be selected by clicking the icon in the top left.
I've tried to get the same look across engines, but not too hard as each works slightly differently and I wanted to have some indication of the differences in the final render.

Some technical stuff
Code is pulled in by creating a script and setting its src property. I experimented with XHR and promises; XHR hides the source file names, promises felt a bit clunky

setTimeout is used to check whether the code has loaded. I tried using onload(), but felt the delay before an error occurred was a too long.

Different web pages can be selected to get an idea of how the widget might look in different settings. I originally did this for debugging purposes.
